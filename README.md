# PiggyFenceGame
A project for MECH423. Made in a night, hackathon style.

Good to know:
- Peggy was a typo. Sorry.
- MSP430FR5739 board reads its accelerometer and sends x, y, z accelerations via serial communication in bytes, then an end byte. So a set of data is in 4 bytes. 
- Fence is controlled by the board.
- There's a how to play button on screen that tells you how to play.
- Unity project is called 9 because it's exercise 9 of lab 1.
- Models, textures, and sounds were from various royalty-free sources.
